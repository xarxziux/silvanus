# Silvanus

Binary search tree implemented in Javascript.

Silvanus is a hobby project and nothing more.  If you are looking for a JavaScript binary tree library for your production needs there are better, more mature, more stable and more feature-rich options out there.  This project brings nothing new to the table.  Instead, this project is a vechicle by which I can try out such things as tooling, unit-testing, package development as well as getting in a little more practice with Javascript coding.

I'm planning on adding to the code base and developing more features to this in the near-future, but it's never likely to rival any of the packages already out there.  I have other interests and projects I want to work on, and there is no gap in the market for this project.
